### Create POST request
Open https://editor.swagger.io/
If it is first time opening it then you don't have to do anything
Otherwise copy openapi.yml file content there

1) Implement POST request that would insert new row to pet table
2) Categories and tags are already inserted, use categor/tag id to insert
3) Fix request body. Remove all fields that are not needed. e.g. category.name. Don't rename or remove fields that are needed
4) Do not change database structure
